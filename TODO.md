# todo 
- merge js/ files and js/src files
- move styling elements in js file to css
- add service-workers to speed up/allow more particles?
- webpack
    - improve the 'code splitting' and 'output management' once enough files 
        are added
- permformance (fan management)
    - theres something causing the fan to start going when using stars
      - solution1: using throttling to stop it?
      - solution2: calling requestAnimationFrame and limiting performance?
      - cause1: is it eating up too much memory? why does the fan start?
- cleanup code for template view engines/libraries (e.g. pug (jade), react)
